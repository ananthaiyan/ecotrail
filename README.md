# EcoTrail

EcoTrail is an AI-powered web application designed to help Indian coal mines quantify their carbon footprint and explore pathways to carbon neutrality. By providing actionable insights, data visualizations, and sustainability recommendations, EcoTrail empowers mine operators to meet their sustainability goals while optimizing operations.

## üöÄ Features

### **Emission Analysis**

- **Activity-wise Carbon Emissions:** Quantify carbon emissions for various mining activities.
- **Per Capita Emissions:** Measure emissions on a per capita basis for better comparability.

### **Sustainability Recommendations**

- **Carbon Neutrality Pathways:** Explore clean technologies, afforestation offsets, renewable energy alternatives, and carbon credits to achieve carbon neutrality.
- **Existing Carbon Sinks:** Estimate current carbon sinks and analyze gaps between emissions and offsets.

### **Interactive Visualizations**

- **Data Visualization Dashboard:** View emissions, gaps, and recommendations through interactive charts and graphs.
- **Mine-Specific Maps:** Search mines by name or location, with legends explaining map markers.

### **AI Assistance**

- **Generative AI for Insights:** Utilize the Gemini API for natural language-based carbon emissions insights and suggestions.
- **Custom Reports:** Generate 3-page reports in natural language summarizing emissions data and recommendations.

### **Scalability**

- Designed to support mines of various sizes and types.
